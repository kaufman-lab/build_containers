# build_containers

This repo builds and stores singularity images to be used in lab workflows.

## Available Images

The set of image types that are available are displayed on the right under "packages".

There are two images types:

-   `geospatial_plus`: Builds on the [rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2) geospatial docker image.

    -   includes a few additional packages (including data.table, intervalaverage and terra)

    -   also has configured the R user library location to avoid clashing with the user library on the host machine.

-   `geospatial_plus_ml`

    -   additionally includes torch for R, and tensorflow for python, and the reticulate package. The version of tensorflow is specifically intel's version for avx512 since this is primarily intended to be run on an intel high performance compute (HPC) cluster.

-   `geospatial_plus_ml_horovod`

    -   additionally includes horovod (tensorflow only, set up for CPU) and openmpi.

## Using Images

If you'd like to test out an image interactively, try

    singularity shell oras://ghcr.io/kaufman-lab/geospatial_plus:4.1.0

Note that singularity will cache remote images, so using the oras URI (as above) may be more convenient than finding a storage location for the .sif file. However, there may be a tradeoff since using the URI pulls a hash so there is probably a slight delay to starting the image. If you want to instead download the image, you can use `singularity pull`.

Please disregard the instructions under github packages on how to pull these images using docker commands. These are not docker images and those commands will not work. Those instructions are auto-generated by github and I don't know how to turn them off.

## Image Requests

Submit an issue if you'd like additional packages or software built into an image.

Depending on the complexity, we may start a new image type (package) or add to an existing image.

## Image Stability

Within a version-tag (e.g. geospatial_plus:4.1.0), R packages built into the image are stable, even when the image (including the underlying rocker image) is rebuilt [because of how versioned rocker images install packages](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/issues/201).  Installing new R packages into the user library, while not recommended (it's better to request a package be added to the image), is also stable (the same version will always be installed) because install.packages by default downloads from a specific date's snapshot of the rstudio package manager.  Python packages built into the image are stable because they are all manually specified as pip install commands with a version specified. However, unlike for R packages, installing python packages into the user directory is not reproducible because pip install will just download the newest version. If anyone is aware of a tool that makes pip install point to a specific day's snapshot of pypi (similar to how rstudio package manager/MRAN works) please let me know.

## Building Images

This repository uses both git a pre-commit hook (to autogenerate definition files) and github actions to build images.

To set up the pre-commit hook, run:

```
git config --local core.hooksPath githooks/
chmod -R u+x githooks
```
